# Steffen's Network Covert Channel Tools

This project contains some of my covert channel projects and also refers to some other repositories where I host my additional covert channel projects.

Please see [my website](http://steffen-wendzel.blogspot.com/p/covert-channel-software.html) for an explanation of these tools.

If you need an introduction, check out **[my free open online class on network covert channels](https://github.com/cdpxe/Network-Covert-Channels-A-University-level-Course/)**.

## In this repository:

- [pct](https://github.com/cdpxe/NetworkCovertChannels/tree/master/pct): *Protocol Channel Tool* (`pct` a PoC implementation to show that so-called protocol channels are feasible).
- [phcct](https://github.com/cdpxe/NetworkCovertChannels/tree/master/phcct): *Protocol Hopping Covert Channel Tool* (`phcct` was the first (2007) implementation of a protocol hopping covert channel).
- [vstt](https://github.com/cdpxe/NetworkCovertChannels/tree/master/vstt): *Very Strange Tunneling Tool* (this was my first network CC tool. I wrote `vstt` as a 2nd semester student. It can tunnel through ICMP, TCP, ...).
- To-do: upload pcaw: *Protocol Channel-aware Active Warden* (`pcaw` is a countermeasure to reduce the channel capacaity of protocol channels (and protocol hopping covert channels), I wrote this in 2012 as contribution to my PhD thesis).

## My other covert channel projects on GitHub

- [NeFiAS](https://github.com/cdpxe/nefias/): *Network Forensic & Anomaly Detection System* (tool for covert channel/network steganography detection).
- [CCEAP](https://github.com/cdpxe/CCEAP): *Covert Channel Educational Analysis Protocol* (a tool for teaching network covert channel patterns).
- [NELphase](https://github.com/cdpxe/NELphase): *Network Environment Learning Phase* (a tool that implements a covert channel capable of performing an network environment learning (NEL) phase and that can be used to test active and passive wardens).

## Tools of my students

- [WiFi Reconnection-based Covert Channel](https://github.com/NIoSaT/WiFi_Reconnection_CovertChannel): My PhD student Sebastian Zillien develop this PoC code for a reconnection-based covert channel that exploits pattern [PT15 (Artificial Reconnections)](https://ih-patterns.blogspot.com/p/pt15-artificial-reconnections.html).
