# NetworkCovertChannels

This project contains some of my covert channel projects and also refers to some other repositories where I host my additional covert channel projects.

Please see [my website](http://steffen-wendzel.blogspot.com/p/covert-channel-software.html) for an explanation of these tools.

## In this repository:

- [phcct](phcct/): *Protocol Hopping Covert Channel Tool* (`phcct` was the first (2007) implementation of a protocol hopping covert channel (also known as protocol switching covert channel).

## My other covert channel projects on GitHub

- [CCEAP](https://github.com/cdpxe/CCEAP): *Covert Channel Educational Analysis Protocol* (a tool for teaching network covert channel patterns)
- [NELphase](https://github.com/cdpxe/NELphase): *Network Environment Learning Phase* (a tool that implements a covert channel capable of performing an network environment learning (NEL) phase and that can be used to test active and passive wardens)
