# NetworkCovertChannels

This project contains some of my covert channel projects and also refers to some other repositories where I host my additional covert channel projects.

Please see [my website](http://steffen-wendzel.blogspot.com/p/covert-channel-software.html) for an explanation of these tools.

## In this repository:

- [pct](https://github.com/cdpxe/NetworkCovertChannels/tree/master/pct): *Protocol Channel Tool* (`pct` a PoC implementation to show that so-called protocol channels are feasible.
- [phcct](https://github.com/cdpxe/NetworkCovertChannels/tree/master/phcct): *Protocol Hopping Covert Channel Tool* (`phcct` was the first (2007) implementation of a protocol hopping covert channel)
- To-do: upload pcaw: *Protocol Channel-aware Active Warden* (`pcaw` is a countermeasure to reduce the channel capacaity of protocol channels (and protocol hopping covert channels), I wrote this in 2012 as partial contribution to my PhD thesis)

## My other covert channel projects on GitHub

- [CCEAP](https://github.com/cdpxe/CCEAP): *Covert Channel Educational Analysis Protocol* (a tool for teaching network covert channel patterns)
- [NELphase](https://github.com/cdpxe/NELphase): *Network Environment Learning Phase* (a tool that implements a covert channel capable of performing an network environment learning (NEL) phase and that can be used to test active and passive wardens)
