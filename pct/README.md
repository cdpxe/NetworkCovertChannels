# PCT â€“ Protocol Channel Tool

This is a proof of concept code for a so-called *[protocol channel](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220488060_Protocol_channels_as_a_new_design_alternative_of_covert_channels?ev=srch_pub&_sg=65eP2guP80mwB2zmsD6YLo6HcJoCQWMHY674Kkkv9q7K7dCru%2FWE7N271ai1wjhi_7w5gwL%2BGRYfQV9%2FC0K%2FLe4tBe8vdrIscunnkQndTWuBZPsKvAdHLtISj%2F9Am7XbO_L2WmsngOI5wDkqi44KBM%2BTL1E55zcN%2B%2FUe8z2qC5VMb6z6GTAKn%2FbDouySJSkQX1)*. The code was written in C and Perl during the winter term 2008/2009 for my diploma thesis at Kempten University of Applied Sciences.

PCT was tested using Linux 2.6.27, using gcc version 4.3.2 (4.3.2-1ubuntu11) on amd64 and i686.

My [website](https://steffen-wendzel.blogspot.com/p/covert-channel-software.html#pct) refers to several publications on protocol channels.
